You could write a long essay unpacking the many implied layers of this phrase,  “[easily perfect all of your memories](https://twitter.com/googlephotos/status/1628803092123885568),” but I really want to bring up something that my friend the photographer Clayton Cubitt taught me: whatever you think is boring or ugly in your photograph today might quite possibly be [the most interesting thing about the photograph in the future](https://austinkleon.com/2021/01/31/what-you-think-is-boring-now-may-be-interesting-in-the-future/).

Knowing this, I am inclined to go the other direction and do my best to _imperfect_ my memories: leave in all the things I’m supposed to crop out. (This is why I leave in all the dumb, mundane crap I do every day in my [logbook](https://austinkleon.com/tag/logbook): what I have for lunch, meetings, what I watched on TV, etc.)

I try to remember that I have no idea today exactly what I’ll want to remember about today in the future.
