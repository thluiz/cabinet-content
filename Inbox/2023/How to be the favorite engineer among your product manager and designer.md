Collaboration is hard.

Especially with product managers (PMs) and designers, it‚Äôs often a difficult balance of priorities.

There‚Äôs usually a deadline, a relationship, and your project impact all at play.

Semi-serious meme for this issue üòÖ

While the above image is for fun, it‚Äôs real for many engineers.

This can be tough. But in this issue, you‚Äôll get **a ton** of actionable advice on how to make the collaboration between you and your PM or designer so much easier.

-   How to overcome the 2 most common challenges when working with your designer or product manager
    
-   How to build a working relationship that makes you one of their favorite engineers to work with.
    

This is almost guaranteed in every project. It‚Äôs pretty darn hard to catch everything ahead of time. **Surprisingly, there are so many ways to work through this effectively.**

There are also a couple of things you definitely shouldn‚Äôt do:

### **What you shouldn‚Äôt do**

-   **Push things off as a fast-follow, then never do them.**
    
    -   If you make this a habit, your product manager will notice it and will start wanting to force you to do it now, since they will lose trust.
        
    -   Additionally, it never looks good if you don‚Äôt follow up on something you say you will do.
        
-   **Saying no by default.**
    
    -   We‚Äôll talk about ways to handle this effectively in ‚ÄúWhat you should do.‚Äù In short, **don‚Äôt become known for saying ‚Äúno.‚Äù** Ideally, you can find effective alternatives and collaborate to an agreement both you and your product manager/designer are happy with.
        
    -   Realize that ‚Äúnot technically feasible‚Äù isn‚Äôt a solid answer. Most things **are** technically feasible. It‚Äôs just about how much effort it will take. If your designer knows the fancy animation they‚Äôre asking for will take 2 weeks, they‚Äôll probably be more willing to let it go.
        

### **What you should do**

-   **Call out as much scope as possible ahead of time.**
    
    -   There are 2 things you can do at the project planning phase.
        
        1) **Be exhaustive in what is in scope. Mainly, error states and edge cases.** These may be product or technical edge cases & limitations. This will ensure these cases are accounted for ahead of time, and not afterthoughts. As you consistently ask how edge cases and error states will be handled, over time your PM and designer will begin to cover them _before_ you ask, which will also start the scope at a more appropriate place.
        
        2) **Include a section for what‚Äôs out of scope**. Add as much as you can that isn‚Äôt in scope. When scope attempts to get added, you can reference back to the original document saying it was agreed to not have it in scope.
        
    -   **Early in the project, before doing your technical design document, do a spike.** A spike is where you just go through the code and spend a day starting to implement the feature without polish. Mock out method implementations, database interactions, make the frontend look ugly, and see what you run into. You‚Äôll likely find some old code you may need to touch or an edge case you didn‚Äôt think of. When you do, you can include that in the scope early on.  
        
-   **Find the root of their goal, and offer alternatives that can be done in less time.**
    
    -   Your product manager and designer won‚Äôt know all the quirks of the system, where the legacy code is, what‚Äôs hard to modify, etc. **You do.** Whenever a suggestion is made by your PM or designer, try to figure out what the underlying goal is and offer an alternative that‚Äôs easier.
        
    -   **For example:** I worked on a team where we wanted to show a pop-up modal to advertise a new feature on a dashboard. We could do this, but due to the existing infrastructure, it would have taken 2-3 weeks. **However, I knew the main goal was to raise awareness for the feature.** I shared that we could do the same modal, but on a different dashboard (it had a lot newer code) and it would only take a few days. Voila! They loved the idea, it saved scope, and still got us the same awareness for the feature. Similarly, I could have suggested other ideas like a banner or email.
        
        (Quick shoutout to [Gregor Ojstersek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregorojstersek/)‚ÄîCTO for [also sharing this](https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/5-learnings-of-a-great-collaboration))
        
-   **Align on a top-level metric.**
    
    -   Take a step back and consider what the goal of the project is. Is it dollars generated? Is it time saved for the user? If the scope-add is not adding toward the top-level metric, politely address that.
        
    -   **For example:** _‚ÄúThis is a good idea. It just may make sense to do this as part of a separate project.‚Äù_ If they ask why or push further: _‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bit worried about us being able to meet the deadline on the eng side. Also, while I think it‚Äôs a great idea, I don‚Äôt know if it will move the needle on the user time-saved goal we wanted.‚Äù_Another way to explain it is, _‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bit worried about having our focus split trying to achieve this and the initial set of tasks. We can do both, I just like the idea of having it treated separately for now.‚Äù_
        
    -   The wording can definitely get tricky here, as you don‚Äôt want to sound too rigid, so take my sample wording as just a general idea. Usually use this as a last resort. The **ideal is finding an alternative or removing scope ahead of time.  
        **(By the way, feel free to share alternative wordings in the comments)
        
-   **Accept the scope, but add people or time.**

If one changes, another needs to change in response](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F948f3a57-0520-4de7-a94e-f53684b8729b_1252x802.png "Time, people, and scope in a triangle.

    Time vs People vs Scope
    
    Above is a helpful diagram (I forget the source‚Äîsorry).
    
    **Sometimes, the right move is to add scope, especially if it aligns well with the goal of the project.** If this is the case, try to get more **resources** or **time**.
    
    **For example:** _‚ÄúThis definitely makes sense to do. It just may take a bit of time. I‚Äôm thinking it could be 1-2 weeks. So if we add this in, we should adjust the deadline. Alternatively, maybe we could loop someone in to help reduce the load so we can meet the existing deadline?‚Äù_Understand that they are just trying to make the product better like you are. It‚Äôs just a matter of deciding on prioritization and scope. Try to think of it from their perspective. This aligns with [Paulo Andre‚Äôs (former VP Eng) advice here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7101215730041278465?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7101215730041278465%2C7101236175700385792%29).
    

We‚Äôve all been there. We may be blocked, waiting on updated designs, or waiting to hear back on how to handle a particular edge case.

**What you should do:**

-   **Take the initiative**
    
    -   One thing designers and PMs love the most is when you can take work off their plate in a respectful way. I usually do this by making a suggestion and asking if that aligns with what they were thinking.
        
    -   **For example:** Sometimes during implementation, I realize there‚Äôs a case we hadn‚Äôt accounted for. I think about how to approach it, do it, then ping them checking if that approach works for them. 90% of the time, they say, _‚ÄúThat works great! Thanks so much for tackling that.‚Äù_
        
-   **Set up 1:1s and share feedback regularly**
    
    -   If the response time is often slowing you down, it‚Äôs important to bring it up and have a place to address it. I suggest having a bi-weekly 1:1 with your designer and product manager to keep a close working bond. In the 1:1 you can catch up on a personal level but also exchange feedback regularly. Also, the 1:1 can be a good place to get unblocked too! It‚Äôs dedicated collaboration time if you need it.
        
    -   **For example:** I usually ask, _‚ÄúIs there anything I should be doing differently or anything that is slowing you down? How did you feel X project went? Was there anything I could have done better?‚Äù_ Usually, asking for feedback opens the other person to ask for some too. There, you can share that the slow response times have been a blocker at times.

Finally, I ‚Äúinterviewed‚Äù my girlfriend, who is a Senior Product Designer and asked,

_‚ÄúWhat did the engineers you enjoyed working with most do that others didn‚Äôt?‚Äù_

Here was her answer:

-   **They kept her up to date with progress.**
    
    -   To do this, regularly show your work-in-progress to get fast feedback. For me, this made a huge difference in building a strong relationship with my designers. It shows them you value their opinion. [Omar Halabieh, Tech Director at Amazon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omarhalabieh/) also [agreed on this point](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7101215730041278465?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7101215730041278465%2C7101219561340829696%29).
        
-   **They were willing to go the extra mile.**
    
    -   They didn‚Äôt automatically reject an additional UI polish because it was out of scope. If it made sense and was reasonable to do, they tackled it. Or they said something like, _‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an awesome addition. I‚Äôm a bit behind right now on trying to meet the deadline but I‚Äôll try to fit this in if I can. I‚Äôll keep you updated on it.‚Äù_
        
-   **They let her be the first one to test the feature (alongside the product manager).**
    
    -   Often as engineers, we believe we‚Äôre the ones entirely responsible for the feature. In reality, we‚Äôre mostly responsible for ‚Äúit not breaking.‚Äù Your designer and product manager are judged by how it looks and feels; so it‚Äôs important they have a chance to verify it since they are held accountable.
        
    -   **A way to** _**really**_ **mess this up is to ship to production without letting your designer double-check it.** I‚Äôve seen cases where designers were held accountable for features they knew nothing about üò¨.
        

-   **When your PM or designer suggests additional scope‚Ä¶**
    
    -   Minimize the problem by calling out as much scope as possible ahead of time.
        
    -   Find the root of their goal, and offer alternatives that can be done in less time.
        
    -   Align on a top-level metric. Use it as a reason for if it should be included.
        
    -   Accept the scope, but add people or time.
        
-   **When your PM or designer is slow to respond‚Ä¶**
    
    -   Take the initiative - Take a best-guess approach and check if it works for them.
        
    -   Set up 1:1s and share feedback regularly - Share where each of you are slowed down. Make it mutual.
        
-   **General tips for building a good relationship‚Ä¶**
    
    -   Regularly share work-in-progress and get feedback.
        
    -   Go the extra mile when it makes sense. Do the additional polish.
        
    -   Ensure your designer & PM can test the feature before going to production.
