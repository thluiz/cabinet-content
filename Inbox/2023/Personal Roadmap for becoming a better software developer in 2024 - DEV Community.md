So, it has been a while since I last focused on self-improvement and building confidence. Despite coding for almost two years, I still struggle with imposter syndrome - that deep feeling of not being good enough. Now, what am I missing out on? I have watched countless videos and attempted to start numerous projects, but I have failed to complete them. During my seven-month internship, I used ChatGPT for most of my tasks, which is not that bad I guess. While some things worked, others did not, and I know I did not put in my best effort. Nevertheless, I am grateful for the opportunity and will always be. Did that job help me? Yes, to some extent, but I was always fearful of new tasks and not fully committed to the job. In short, what should I do now? Currently, I lack motivation to learn something new, but I hate this version of myself. I believe I have been approaching things the wrong way. So, here is a roadmap to start fresh and learn everything from scratch.

-   First, I need to address the fact that my foundation is not strong enough. I will start by focusing on the basics and learning data structures and algorithms. How will I do that? Simple, by watching YouTube, but not excessively. I will primarily follow three to five channels.
    
-   I will also review my skills in vanilla JavaScript and create new projects using only JavaScript. Additionally, I will learn DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) with JavaScript.
    
-   I will make an effort to improve my communication and writing skills.
    
-   I must start solving problems on LeetCode and HackerRank as soon as possible.
    
-   I will try to be more active on LinkedIn.
    
-   Once I am comfortable with DSA, I will build new projects to enhance my frontend skills. I will dedicate my focus to frontend development, as I am more comfortable with it and have experience with React from my internship.
    
-   I will also create a new portfolio, possibly using Next.js/React.
    
-   I will invest in courses and books when I am financially stable.
    

Now that I have identified what I need to do to improve myself, the list above will serve as my personal roadmap. However, most importantly, it would be great if I could become more disciplined. After wasting so much time, I have come to realize that consistency is the key to becoming a better software developer. It can be achieved through having a job or coding and learning almost every day. There is simply no other way. So, my suggestion to myself is to prioritize consistency and discipline.

Happy Coding.
