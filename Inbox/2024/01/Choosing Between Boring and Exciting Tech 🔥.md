# Choosing Between Boring and Exciting Tech ðŸ”¥

> ## Excerpt
> Advice for dealing with technology risk, using something more than your gut.

---
In 2011, when I was 22, I decided it was finally time for me to buy a smartphone.

I wrote down a long list of pros and cons for a few top tier models, including the iPhone 4 and a couple of Android phones.

In my head, however, I had already decided I wanted the iPhone. The real goal of the list was to justify this decision to myself and to my friends and family.

We make so many decisions this way, whether we realize it or not. We have a gut feeling for something, and then we work our way to rationalize it.

Choosing which technologies to use is one of those areas where "gut" often wins. This is because pros and cons are so hard to articulateâ€”and so obscure to most decision makersâ€”that over the years I have seen many such choices being backed by little more than personal taste.

Dan McKinley wrote [a famous piece](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) years ago about so-called _Boring Technologies_. Read it if you havenâ€™t. My take is that, other things being equal(-ish), our gut naturally optimizes for _Exciting_ Tech over _Boring_ Tech.

The iPhone 4 felt exciting, while the other phones felt boring.

This _instinct_ is neither a good nor a bad thing. We just need to be aware of it, and act accordingly. Let's talk about tech choices ðŸ‘‡
