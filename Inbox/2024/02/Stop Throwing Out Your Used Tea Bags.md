It feels so good to be able to do something with the things we’d normally discard. [Coffee grounds](https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/used-coffee-grounds-uses-tips-255344) as rose fertilizer and [clementine peels](https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/how-to-make-a-clementine-candle-video-1453) saved for DIY candles come to mind, not to mention composting in general.

If you’re a regular or occasional tea drinker, you can add your tea bags to the list of garbage you shouldn’t throw out just yet. Here are some ways to re-use them post brew:

-   **Add a hint of [flavor to rice or grains](http://www.naturallivingideas.com/used-tea-bags/).** Hang your used tea bags in boiling water to infuse your food with a touch of flavor. Think jasmine tea with rice or chai tea with oatmeal.
-   **Protect house plants from fungal disease** by re-brewing a used tea bag and using the weak tea (cooled) to water your plants.
-   **Neutralize odors naturally.** Spread dried tea leaves in stinky spots like the cat litter box or in the bottom of your garbage bags.
-   **Make [cleaning the fireplace](https://housewifehowtos.com/save-money/ways-reuse-tea-bags/) safer and easier.** Dump the damp contents of tea bags onto the ash to weigh it down before sweeping out the fireplace.
-   **De-grease pots and pans.** Soak hard-to-clean dishes in water with a used tea bag tossed in. The tea will help loosen stuck-on food and break up grease.
-   **Add them to your bath.** The antioxidants in tea are good for your skin and the gentle scent will add some aromatherapy to your soak.
-   **Take the sting out of [insect bites and sunburns](http://www.chasinggreen.org/article/25-ways-re-use-tea-bags/).** Using a cool compress will reduce pain and inflammation of the affected areas.
-   **Make a hair rinse.** [Remove product buildup](https://housewifehowtos.com/save-money/ways-reuse-tea-bags/) without using another product. Soak 3-4 used tea bags in warm water and pour it over your head after shampooing and conditioning as usual. Don’t rinse. Pro tip: Chamomile brightens blondes and black tea adds a coppery shimmer to brunettes, according to [Housewife How-Tos](https://housewifehowtos.com/save-money/ways-reuse-tea-bags/).
-   [**Deodorize carpets**](http://www.chasinggreen.org/article/25-ways-re-use-tea-bags/) by scattering the dried contents of several teabags over your rugs before you vacuum.
-   **Depuff tired eyes.** Place cool tea bags over your eyes, cucumber style. According to [Chasing Green](http://www.chasinggreen.org/article/25-ways-re-use-tea-bags/), the tannins in the tea leaves may reduce bags and dark circles.
-   **[Clean leather shoes](http://www.chasinggreen.org/article/25-ways-re-use-tea-bags/)** by buffing with a damp teabag.
-   **Wash stinky hands,** using a tea bag as you would a bar of soap to help [eradicate garlic, onion, or fish odors](http://boredomtherapy.com/hacks-for-tea-bags/).
