The JavaScript cropping plugin is returning the image as base64 text, this is fine as in Html we can bind an image to a base64 string by setting the "src" attribute. However, in my case I need to convert this base64 image to byte array to save the binary in the SQL database then create the physical file of the cropped image. You may ask why I need to convert the base64 image to byte array. I'm doing this for one simple reason, because the base64 image can be a large text in the Html which will increase the size of the page, as a result it can affect the page load time. Therefore, for better performance it is recommended to
