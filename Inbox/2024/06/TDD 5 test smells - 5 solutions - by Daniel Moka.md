# TDD: 5 test smells - 5 solutions - by Daniel Moka

> ## Excerpt
> 5 practical tips to improve the quality of your tests

---
## Motivation

_Hey TDD friend! This is FREE lesson from my upcoming [Test-Driven Development course](https://craftbettersoftware.com/p/launching-my-tdd-course-in-2-weeks). I launch it next Monday on 3rd June with a 50% discount. The discount will be valid only for 3 days, so stay tuned._

You can‚Äôt have clean code without clean tests. Treat your tests as first-class citizens. Writing clean tests is as important as writing clean production code.

When I help teams to improve their testing practices, I always see the same 5 test smells. Here‚Äôs what they are, how to detect them, and how you can fix them:

## 1\. Fragile tests

#### ‚ùå Problem

Your tests fail to compile when you change the production code.

#### üîÉ Cause

Your tests are coupled to low-level implementation details such as internal functions or classes.

As you see in this example below, the test is coupled to implementation details like _**FindById(..)**_ and _**Store(..)**_ methods.

#### ‚úÖ Solution

**Don't couple your tests to implementation details or code structure. Instead, couple them to the behaviors of the public APIs.**

The following test uses fake to verify state changes without being coupled to the internal functions:

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c9c41aa-8373-4a32-8c16-aefcc4889243_775x595.png)

## 2\. Eager tests

#### ‚ùå Problem

The test is hard to understand as it verifies too much functionality in a single test method.

#### üîÉ Cause

Having multiple Act and Assert parts within a test.

The following test is an Eager Test because it covers multiple behaviors: bank account creation, deposit, invalid withdrawal, and successful withdrawal.

#### ‚úÖ Solution

You can fix the Eager Test smell **by splitting up the test into multiple test cases.** Each test should verify a single condition:

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbed12fbd-a5cb-4d0a-b7ac-8e021988ae75_2318x1970.png)

## 3\. Mistery **Guest**

#### ‚ùå Problem

The reader must look outside the test to understand the behavior being verified.

#### üîÉ Cause

Some global context is used to initialize data for reusing objects and avoiding duplication.

In the following test, we don‚Äôt have any info about the _**User**_ as it is initialized outside the test context:

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7fad793-3362-4c86-9d70-971c684e33c7_2850x1060.png)

#### ‚úÖ Solution

**Include everything needed in the test to understand the tested behavior.** The Don't Repeat Yourself principle is less important in test code. Prefer readability over removing duplication:

## 4\. Test with irrelevant data

#### ‚ùå Problem

It's hard to tell which data affects the test result.

#### üîÉ Cause

There is too much irrelevant information in the test case.

[

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6098740a-13e5-4fbd-bfd4-62b3a117eea5_6194x1676.png)

#### ‚úÖ Solution

**Don't pollute your tests with irrelevant test data!** Irrelevant data increases noise and decreases readability. A test should read like a story with only the essential information.

There are two great ways to hide irrelevant data:

-   abstract irrelevant information into a method
    
-   use the builder pattern

## 5\. Test with logic

#### ‚ùå Problem

Tests are too complex to understand and prone to bugs.

#### üîÉ Cause

You use logic in tests such as if-else statements, loops, or switch cases.

[

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44985c13-96ee-4a47-b625-c168e2df325e_2889x2166.png)

#### ‚úÖ Solution

**Avoid any logic in your test code!** Once you feel the need for these, it's a smell that you test more than one thing. You can get rid of test logic by splitting up your tests into multiple test cases.

Another option is to use parameterized tests to declare your test cases and to avoid duplication:
