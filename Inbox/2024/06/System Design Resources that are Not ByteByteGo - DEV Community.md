System design is a core engineering skill and everyone on your team should have [some degree of understanding of their system‚Äôs architecture](https://www.multiplayer.app/blog/why-everyone-in-your-team-should-understand-the-system-architecture-even-a-little/).

In addition to that, with the rise in the adoption of AI coding assistants, mastering this skill will safeguard your professional career ensuring that you remain relevant and productive in an evolving technological landscape.

Traditionally, junior developers have been taught to focus primarily on learning coding skills and mastering the fundamentals of their chosen technologies. However, AI assistants, like GitHub Copilot, are significantly accelerating coding tasks‚Äî55% of users report coding faster. This acceleration frees up time for developers to delve deeper into system intricacies, thereby gaining expertise in the environments they create and adopting a more holistic approach to software system development.

Inbal Shani, former CPO at GitHub, [emphasized this shift in mindset](https://youtu.be/f10s3rxKaJw?si=ZeXagayKdPyXsGwk&t=508):

> _Developers need to form a different thinking \[‚Ä¶\] more systems, more architecture. You need to start figuring out how to use the AI tools to help you be successful. It's no longer just the actual code writing, it's really evolving your thinking to see the big picture, the connected experience, and the connected systems._

This mindset, once primarily associated with senior software engineers, is now becoming essential for all developers. The gap between senior and junior developers is narrowing, especially as 92% of developers are already leveraging AI tools.

üëâ The time to start learning system design is now. üëà

Unfortunately, the discourse around system design often centers on ‚Äú[how to ace a system design interview](https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-10-system-design-interview-books-in-2024-3e69e182e092)‚Äù. While it's true that system design is a critical skill for many organizations, particularly given the prevalence of distributed systems, this focus on interview preparation neglects the importance of applying these skills in day-to-day, real-world scenarios.

This hyper-focus on technical interviews is akin to the institution of standardized testing‚Äîit has its uses but is inherently limited. It fails to provide a complete picture of the real-world challenges and the creative, adaptive thinking required to effectively apply system design knowledge and skills in practical contexts.

Furthermore, the industry is currently [experiencing a shift in the role and significance of Software Architect](https://www.multiplayer.app/blog/the-rise-of-modern-software-architects/)s. We're recognizing that system and software design are not confined to specific roles; every engineer should possess some level of proficiency in these areas. Having system design experience and considering architectural requirements during coding makes you a better engineer and leads to superior products.

However, many engineers and organizations have yet to embrace this trend, maintaining a strict differentiation between engineers and various types of Software Architects.

Lastly, the most significant issue: system design is often misconceived as merely diagramming, producing specific documents, or adhering to codified frameworks. In reality, system design is an ongoing **process** that outlines the high-level conceptual structure of a complex system (the system architecture) and defines its major components and interactions. While it **can** result in outputs such as system diagrams, Architectural Design Records, or the use of specific tools and frameworks, it encompasses how a team builds software and not just the tools that they use to help throughout the process.

When researching system design, the internet often surfaces two primary resources:

-   The [ByteByteGo Newsletter](https://blog.bytebytego.com/)
-   [Corporate Engineering Blogs](https://bytesizeddesign.substack.com/p/the-byte-sized-design-list-of-system)

I want to emphasize that **both are extremely helpful** and I highly recommend them. In fact, we are subcribers to - and avid fans of - the ByteByteGo Newsletter and its authors [Alex Xu](https://x.com/alexxubyte) and [Sahn Lam](https://x.com/sahnlam). Conveying complex concepts in a fun and visual way is an art and reading their newsletter is always a pleasure.

Likewise, it‚Äôs fascinating to learn how companies like Netflix, Google, Stripe, or Spotify design their systems and discover the clever solutions they‚Äôve implemented. However, chances are you‚Äôre not working on a system as mammoth as theirs and their approaches are often tailored to these specific use cases.

Indeed, there is **no single right way** to architect a system. The design depends on your business requirements, development stage, and the trade-offs you‚Äôre willing to make.

In addition to ByteByteGo and various corporate blogs, I highly recommend checking these resources. They are not mentioned nearly as often, but they can teach you a lot about system design:

üìå NB. These are just general categories that helped **me** categorize them, so there is some overlap.
