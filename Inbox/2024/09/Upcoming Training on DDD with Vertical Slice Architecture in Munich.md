I've got another training event coming up focusing on Domain-Driven Design with Vertical Slice Architecture in Munich on October 21-23rd.

A little different than the previous times I've given this course is an option for either a 2-day or 3-day version. I had received feedback that folks were also interested in larger-scale design concepts such as bounded contexts, messaging, integration patterns, microservices, and modular monoliths. So I've included a 3rd day that covers these topics, where we look at encapsulation and cohesion at larger and larger scopes.

We'll cover:

-   Refactoring an existing system to leverage Vertical Slice Architecture
-   Applying Domain-Driven Design techniques to model complex business needs
-   Communication between slices
-   Exploring Validation and Testing (and other cross-cutting concerns) using Vertical Slice Architecture
-   Examining various design patterns, code smells, and refactoring techniques
-   Implementing the Vertical Slice Architectural pattern in various enterprise application scenarios (minimal APIs, Blazor, Web APIs, etc.)

And on the final day:

-   Service boundaries and bounded contexts
-   Communication between bounded contexts
-   Microservices and modular monoliths
-   Studying distributed systems patterns, tools, and libraries such as NServiceBus

The course pulls together my experiences building such systems for nearly 20 years now. And if you can't make the course during the day, I'm also hosting a networking event during the evening where you can meet myself and the other attendees and ask me questions. I hope to see you there!
