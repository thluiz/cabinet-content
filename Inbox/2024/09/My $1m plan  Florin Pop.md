I turned 30 a few months ago and I want to become a millionaire by the time I hit 40.

This gives me 10 years to figure things out, while also (hopefully 🤞) not burning myself out in the process [again](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/i-failed-before).

So if you’re wondering why I’m giving myself so much time, here’s the answer, lol.

## Little about me

At my core, I’ve been a developer since 2013, and in the last 5 years I’ve also:

-   wrote articles on my blog (this one)
-   made a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@florinpop) ($50k)
-   wrote an [eBook](https://florinpop17.gumroad.com/l/makemoneydev) ($30k)
-   co-created a [coding course](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/?referralCode=684EE5F9DE1745B6428B) ($150k)
-   made a [SaaS](https://icodethis.com/?ref=florin-pop-1m-blog) ($60k)
-   started communities (P.S. Dev++ Community Comming soon 👀)

And some other ventures…

As you can see, during these 5 years I made about $300k from various projects and the plan is to continue this to bring my net worth to $1m in the next decade.

For the fun of it, here I’ll start documenting from $0 revenue up to $1m. We’ll just keep it simple without considering the previous amounts (which went on taxes, expenses and some investments).

Just keep in mind that I already have projects that bring in some revenue every month, and I have an audience on [X](https://x.com/florinpop1705) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@florinpop).

I don’t believe having an audience is a requirement to complete this challenge but it’s not bad to have, of course.

## Why $1m?

This is how much we’d need to be financially free. (we = me + wifey 💜)

This amount invested would give us $40k per year based on the safe withdrawal rate of 4% which will give us a pretty good lifestyle on “autopilot” financially.

If I _really_ think about it… the main goal is **freedom**. Freedom to do **what I want**, **when I want**, with **whoever I want**.

Do we _really_ need $1m invested though for that? No, not really. With a $4-5k monthly income, we’d be good to go.

But it would be nice to have that as passively as possible. And, it wouldn’t be such a fun challenge if it would be super easy, amirite? 😆

So… $1m it is!

## How do I plan to make money?

I plan to continue launching and monetizing apps and products, while sharing the process online → this will help with the marketing/distribution side of things. Besides this, I also want to learn how to use paid ads.

___

To begin with, I need to hone down my dev and marketing skills.

I need to learn how to:

-   launch an MVP of an idea fast
-   market it to the right audience
-   see if it’s worth doubling down on (if it brings in enough revenue), or it’s a sign I need to move on to the next idea
-   automate everything where possible

To launch an MVP fast I already know how to build websites (the frontend) but I need to learn better how to do the backend side (how to set up auth, db, payments, etc).

For **marketing**, I’ll:

-   launch on different channels (Reddit, hacker news, indie hackers, product hunt?)
-   make videos and/or streams about it
-   talk about the product in public
-   learn and try ads (heard these are powerful if done right)

## The actionable plan

Since I don’t necessarily need a big hit fast, I was thinking of launching many small apps to see what skills I lack or need to improve.

I like the idea of launching many small bets. Trying many things and seeing what works. This will force me to act fast, fail fast, and learn fast.

### Challenge: Launch 100 projects (Crazy, eh? 😆)

If let’s say, hypothetically, I’ll launch 100 projects and apps in the next 10 years, and on average each of the apps makes $100 per month, that’s $10k per month in total.

I know this is just the theory and in reality only a few will be successful… But considering the high amount of apps (100), I believe that this will create a big surface area for luck to fit in at some point.

And even if it doesn’t work out, during this time I’m going to develop strong skills that will help a lot in other areas. For example, I could switch my focus to helping other businesses launch and try their ideas, as I’ll have stronger dev & marketing skills.

All in all, I think this will turn out well eventually.

At least I hope so, lol. 😆

Nonetheless, I’m going to share my experience here so… Stick around to see what’s going to happen.

Cya! 🫶
