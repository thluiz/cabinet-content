#### Video resumes can be the most powerful tool in your job search kit. A well-made video resume is worth a thousand words and can help you stand out from other applicants and get noticed by recruiters.

In order for you to take advantage of all [the benefits of a video resume](https://snaphunt.com/advice/jobSearchAdvice/why-you-need-a-video-resume), it is very important that your video resume is well scripted and professionally presented. Here are some things to keep in mind when recording your video resume.

### 1\. Write a great script

A great way to start is to write what you want to cover in your video resume. In order to make your video resume impactful, think about what you are trying to achieve (_eg. I want recruiters who have senior finance roles to contact me)_ and ensure that what you write is completely focused on achieving this.

Your video resume should cover 4 main points. I have included examples so that you get a better idea of how you can draft your own script:

##### **An overview of your experience**

Summarise your experience so far. Start with an overview and mention your latest role in 1–2 sentences. For example, _“Hi, my name is Jane Smith and I am a qualified accountant with 10 years’ experience in audit as well as financial planning & analysis within consumer goods and pharmaceutical industries. I am currently working as a Business Planning Manager in ABC pharmaceuticals where I am responsible for…”_

##### **Your main skills**

Mention the key skills you bring to the table. For example, _“I have strong knowledge of US GAAP and have worked with SAP and Oracle…”_

##### **An overview of your soft skills and achievements**

Mention your soft skills and how these have led you to achieve success in your career. For example, _“I am a commercially focused finance professional who works closely with cross functional teams in my organisations to ensure business objectives are met.”_

##### **What you are looking for**

Mention your career objective and what sort of roles/ companies you would love to have discussions with if you are looking out for jobs right now. If you are using a video resume as just a complement to your social profile, you can skip this part. For example, _“As a next step, I am interested in exploring senior finance roles which involve managing teams across multiple countries…”_

After writing a first draft of your video resume script, read it out loud to see if the tone and words you use sound like you are having a conversation. In a great video resume, it is important to sound like you are speaking to a recruiter rather than reading a script. If your script is sounding too ’scripted’, change your sentences to sound more natural.

Once your draft script is ready, ensure it is of optimum length. Your video resume should be ideally 1 minute long and definitely never more than 2 minutes long. This is to ensure it retains the interest of recruiters and the discipline of keeping a shorter length will also ensure you focus only the most important points and make your content as impactful as possible.

### 2\. Choose the right software

While you can record your video resume on any device, it is best to choose software that has been created to help you record and distribute video resumes with ease. When choosing software for your video resume, consider the following:

##### **Does it offer a tele-prompter?**

Unless you are a professional actor, it is going to be difficult to remember your script and deliver it flawlessly as a video resume. If you try and learn your script by heart, you may end up sounding stressed and mechanical while delivering it on video. Finally, if you need to keep referring to notes as you speak, you will need to keep looking away from the camera, leading to a less than impactful delivery. As a result, it is important you use a video resume software that allows you to type/paste in your script and see it with a teleprompter while recording your video. [Snaphunt](https://snaphunt.com/) offer free video resume builders with built in teleprompters so you can record and share your video resume with ease.

##### **Is the video easy to share?**

Video files can be heavy and hence it is important that your video resume is shareable via a video link or a QR code. QR codes are great for paper resumes as they can be scanned easily by employers to access your profile. For online platforms or profile, it is best to share video links so that recruiters can easily click and access your resume.

### 3\. Create a perfect set up to record your video

Once you have identified the right software and finalized your script, it is time to turn your attention to recording your video resume! When creating your set up to record your resume keep the following things in mind:

##### **Choose a plain background**

In your video resume, the focus of attention needs to be you! Record your video in front of a plain wall or background to avoid any visual distractions.

##### **Check your camera angle and light**

In your video resume, visual impact plays a very important role. Create a great impact by positioning a light to face you when you record your resume. This will make you look brighter and more dynamic in your video. In terms of camera coverage and angle, adjust your camera so that your shoulder and the top of your arms are visible in your video so that you can gesture naturally if required. Try and position your camera so that it is slightly higher than your head and angled slightly downwards to get the most flattering angle.

##### **Check your equipment**

This many sound basic — but clean your device camera lens to get a crisp looking video. I have personally seen too many ‘fuzzy’ looking videos which could have been so much more impactful had the fingerprint/ dust been wiped off from the camera before recording!

If you are using an online software, ensure a good internet connectivity. Before recording, also check that your device is well charged and connected to a power socket.

##### **Choose a quiet place with minimal background noise**

Finally, record your video resume in a place with minimal background noise to avoid audio distractions.

### 4\. Dress for the occasion

Dress for your video resume the way you would dress in a video interview. You can be dressed semi-casually for your recording as being too formal may make you look very uptight. If you are in a profession where casual wear is the norm, you can do your video resume in a T shirt. When choosing what you wear, avoid prints or stripes and wear a solid color which is contrasting to your background. For example, if you are recording a video resume against a white wall, avoid a white shirt and choose a blue shirt or a black t-shirt instead.

### 5\. Have the right body language

The aim of the video resume is to get your personality across to a recruiter. Relax, have fun while recording and do not forget to smile! This can help you come across as more approachable and confident. Also lean slightly forward towards the camera as you speak and avoid the urge to fold your arms to come across as more approachable.

### 6\. Practice makes perfect

Let me tell you a secret — I am a hopeless introvert. Many people expect that to be able to ace things like video resumes, you need to be an extrovert. This is simply not true. Creating a good video resume is simply a skill. Practice recording your video and show versions to a friend till you are happy with a version of your video resume that is ready to share!

### 7\. Share it on your social profile and applications

Once you have your video resume ready, choose channels that you can share it in. Adding your video resume link as a Featured link on your LinkedIn profile can be a great way to highlight your profile to potential recruiters who spend hours every day scouring LinkedIn profiles for their open roles. You can also include both a link as well as a QR code of your video resume to your CV so that it is easily accessible to recruiters both online and offline.

A well-made video resume is worth a thousand words and can help you stand out from other applicants and get noticed by recruiters.
