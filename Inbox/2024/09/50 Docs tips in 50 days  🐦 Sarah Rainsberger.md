I realized while working _on_ this site that it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve written _for_ this site!

So, I‚Äôm hoping I can jump-start my writing by taking advantage of the delightful coincidence that I‚Äôve got 50 days left until I‚Äôm 50 and motivate myself to write one, small, helpful or interesting tidbit per day.

(At least, I hope they are! They are things that help me while [leading Astro‚Äôs community-driven documentation site](https://www.rainsberger.ca/blog/community-driven-astro-docs/).)

I‚Äôll make a separate post for each one, and will share in [a Fediverse thread on my Mastodon account](https://mastodon.social/@sarah11918/112671713862058779) but I‚Äôll come back to this one and update the list as we go.

Let‚Äôs see if I can do it!
