# Senior Elixir Developer / Technical Lead - Long-Term Remote Position

> ## Excerpt
> Join our team as a Senior Elixir Developer / Technical Lead for a long-term remote position. Work on a high-performance SaaS application with significant enterprise clients.

---
### About the Role

We are seeking a highly experienced Senior Developer / Technical Lead with a minimum of 10 years of total professional experience, including a proven track record in technical leadership roles. This key position combines hands-on coding with high-level technical leadership responsibilities, requiring someone who can work independently while collaborating with our CTO and development team.

Strong, professional Elixir experience is a must for this role. Our team includes some of the most seasoned Elixir developers in the industry, including open-source maintainers and contributors to the Elixir language itself. Many team members own or have made significant contributions to major projects in the Elixir ecosystem, with some having over a decade of experience in functional programming and distributed systems.

Given the exceptional caliber of our existing team, the successful candidate will need to demonstrate exceptional technical skills and leadership ability to be viewed as a tech lead beyond just holding the title. To be considered a credible tech lead, candidates should have a history of guiding and influencing teams of senior developers, contributing to architectural decisions that have shaped large-scale systems, and driving technical innovation in previous roles.

While we may consider truly exceptional candidates with less Elixir experience, this would only be for individuals who excel significantly in other aspects of the role and have been specifically seeking opportunities to work with Elixir. Such candidates must demonstrate the ability to rapidly achieve proficiency in Elixir and contribute at a high level immediately.

This is a long-term contract position with our consulting company, Xuku LLC, working exclusively with a seed-stage startup client. The product we're developing has already secured significant enterprise clients, underscoring the importance and potential of this project. You'll be deeply involved with the client's product, but your direct relationship will be with our consulting company.

Candidates located in the Americas or Western Europe are preferred. The candidate's working hours will need to overlap for several hours per day with our CTO, who is based in California.
