However, contrasting colours aren’t the only ones that matter. Colours right beside each other on the wheel also complement each other, like purple, indigo, and pink. You can also form a colour scheme or a colour palette by pinpointing three colours that form a triangle on the circle or four colours that form a rectangle. So for a triad, you’d get purple, green, and orange.

You can also play with purple in its various tints and shades, and mix and match with neutrals like white, black, grey, [and brown](https://www.bhg.com.au/colours-that-go-with-brown). Honestly, the possibilities are endless.

## 10 colours that go with purple

## Purple and green

We’re calling it. Aubergine colour schemes will always be in style – it’s backed up by theory after all. As contrasting colours, purple and green go together in perfect harmony. The rich jewel tones of purple and green gives off moody and dramatic, and really calls out to feelings of richness and royalty.

In pastel hues, this colour combination is perfect to create a sense of calm in busy common areas, like bathrooms and kitchens.

## Purple and blue

[Blue and purple](https://www.bhg.com.au/colours-that-go-with-blue-complementary-colours-for-blue) together is the stuff of dreams. The colour combo reminds us of cotton candy and early childhood. This colour combo can work well in pastel scenarios or in darker gemstone colourways.

A darker palette will work best with standalone pieces that make a statement against neutrals of black, grey and white.

**Fun fact:** Even the famous apartment from _Friends_ benefitted from a blue and purple colour palette.

## Purple and mustard

Purple and yellow, or purple and mustard, are complementary colours on the colour wheel. This means that they are complete opposites to each other, and work well together to create a harmonious look. Incorporating these two colours into your homewares and living spaces will balance a room and level the colour palette. 

However, it can be tricky to match the right purple to the right yellow. If you're aiming for a nice mustard accent, we suggest choosing a more reddish-purple so that the tones are closer to the warmer side.

## Brown and purple

The brown and purple colour combination is a no-brainer. Dark purple like plum looks great next to [tan, coffee, or beige.](https://www.bhg.com.au/colours-that-go-with-brown) For an outfit, the combo results in a more muted, professional look with just a hint of colour.

## Purple and grey

While purple’s complementary colours are green and yellow, you can’t go wrong with a [neutral grey](https://www.bhg.com.au/colours-that-go-with-grey). Grey and purple work well to create a more dramatic look within a room, as the grey subdues or levels elements and furniture, the purple is enabled to flourish.

## Purple, pink, and blue

This fun combination is both symbolic and super cute. These colours together can have childish connotations, so why not lean into that and create a playful, lively atmosphere to live and work in. This colour trio is perfect for areas of the house that are used for visiting guests or communal rooms that need a bit of funk. 

Pops of yellow and warm oranges will play into the purple and tie the colours together even more.

## Do red and purple go together?

Red and purple usually clash. But there’s a saying that goes, “_you need to know the rules to break them_”. This is true for coupling red and purple together. While red is usually quite bold, and purple mostly calm (even though it always pops in a room!), putting them together creates a contrast that elicits dramatic power and strength.
