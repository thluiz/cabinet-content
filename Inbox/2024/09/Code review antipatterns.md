## Introduction

Code review seems like a great idea, right? Two developers looking at the same code means two chances to spot problems; it spreads understanding of the way the project is evolving; the reviewer can learn useful tricks from reading the author’s code in detail, or spot opportunities to teach the author a useful trick that they didn’t know already.

But that’s only for ‘light side’ code reviewers, who use it to try to improve the code base and the developers’ collective skills. Code review can also be a powerful tool for totally different purposes. When a code reviewer turns to the dark side, they have a huge choice of ways to obstruct or delay improvements to the code, to annoy patch authors or discourage them completely, or to pursue other goals of their own.

If you’ve only recently turned to the dark side, you might not have thought of all the possibilities yet. So here’s a list of code-review antipatterns, for the dark-side code reviewer who’s running out of ideas.

## The antipatterns

### The Death of a Thousand Round Trips

You start reading the code. As soon as you see a nitpick, you add a review comment pointing it out. Then you stop reading.

The developer conscientiously fixes your nitpick, and submits a revised patch.

You start reading that version. You spot another nitpick, independent of the first. You _could_ perfectly well have mentioned it the first time, but you didn’t, because you didn’t get that far. So you point that out – and stop reading again.

And so on. Iterate until the developer loses hope.

If you’re in a very different time zone from the developer, you get a natural 24-hour round-trip time, so that the patch evolves as slowly as possible. If you’re in a nearby time zone, or the same one, then to delay the patch properly, you’ll have to arrange to be busy with several other things, so you have a good excuse for it taking you a day or two to get round to looking at each new version.

Resist the temptation to make any remarks like ‘This is looking much better now.’ If you hint that you’re getting closer to being satisfied, you’ll give them reason to keep trying!

### The Ransom Note

This particular patch seems _especially_ important to the developer who submitted it. (Maybe they said that outright, as part of their argument trying to persuade you to take the patch. Or maybe you just read between the lines.)

But this patch isn’t especially vital to you – so you’re in a position of power! Now you can hold the change they need hostage until they do lots of extra tangentially related work, which doesn’t really need to be in the same commit, but which is important to _you_.

‘If you ever want to see your beloved patch again …’

### The Double Team

One patch. Two reviewers.

Every time one of you demands a change, the developer obediently makes it – and now the other one can complain instead!

Keep taking turns to make incompatible demands. But always direct your comments at the developer. Avoid arguing directly with _each other_ on the review thread, and don’t acknowledge any suggestion from the patch author that the two of you should talk to each other and come to a consensus about what the patch is supposed to look like.

See how many times you can ping-pong the developer back and forth before they give up.

(In a real emergency, if you can’t find an accomplice, you can try contradicting _your own_ previous review comments. But normally someone will notice. It works better with two reviewers.)

### The Guessing Game

There’s a problem, and lots of different possible ways to solve it. A developer has picked one solution and submitted a patch.

Criticise that _particular_ solution, on some grounds that don’t relate to whether or not it solves the problem. Keep your criticism vague and woolly: violation of an obscure design principle, perhaps, or incompatibility with some vapourware plan for future development in the same area. Make the criticism as irrelevant as possible to the thing they were really trying to achieve.

If you make it vague enough, the developer won’t be able to think of any way to adapt their existing patch that they’re confident will address your criticisms. Their best bet is to choose a totally _different_ solution to the original problem, and try implementing that instead.

So now you can smack that one down too, in just as unhelpful a way!

Don’t let the developer trap you into any conversation like ‘ok, how do you think this problem _should_ be solved?’, or give any hint at a solution you’d be happy with. Sooner or later, they’ll lose the will to keep guessing.

### The Priority Inversion

In your first code review passes, pick small and simple nits. Variable names are a bit unclear; comments have typos in.

Wait for the developer to fix those, and _then_ drop your bombshell: there’s a much more fundamental problem with the patch, that needs a chunk of it to be completely rewritten – which means throwing away a lot of the nitpick fixes you’ve already made the developer do in that part of the patch.

Nothing says ‘your work is not wanted, and your time is not valued’ better than making someone do a lot of work and then making them throw it away. This might be enough to make the developer give up, all by itself.

### The Late-Breaking Design Review

An enormously complicated piece of work has been ongoing for weeks or months, in lots of separate patches. Half the work is already committed.

You personally don’t agree with the design of the entire piece of work, but you weren’t consulted in the original discussions. Or maybe you were, but you were on the losing side of the debate.

But now you’ve been asked to review a minor but important thing in the middle of it, like an easy fix for a bug that’s blocking lots of developers. This is your opportunity!

Demand justification for the entire design of the work so far. If the developer doesn’t know the answers, because they’re just working on one small part of the overall job, then shrug – that’s not your problem, and you’re not hitting the ‘Approve’ button until you’re satisfied.

If you’re really lucky, perhaps you can even manipulate this developer into undoing some of the already-done work, by giving a plausible excuse why it’s necessary. Carefully avoid letting them know where to find the design discussions that contradict you.

### The Catch-22

If there’s one big patch, then it’s too hard to read! Demand it be split up into self-contained sub-pieces.

On the other hand, if there are lots of little patches, then some of them make no sense on their own! So insist that they be glued back together.

With any large enough piece of work you can surely find a reason to make _one_ of those complaints; it’s just a matter of deciding which.

It doesn’t have to be ‘number of patches in the pull request’. You can do this one with any kind of tradeoff that seems relevant in the particular case. For example, if the code is written legibly, it probably has unacceptably poor performance – or if it’s well optimised, it’s unreadable and hard to maintain.

### The Flip Flop

There’s a type of change that people commonly make to the same part of the code, like adding an extra thing to a list. You’ve reviewed several of these changes before. Another one has just come along: the author has looked at the prior changes, carefully followed the existing pattern, and chosen you as a code reviewer because you’re clearly used to this area.

Keep everybody on their toes by suddenly objecting to an aspect of the change that you’ve never had a problem with before. Following the existing pattern just isn’t good enough! The author ought to have anticipated that you’ve recently changed your mind about what this type of change should look like.

What if the author points out your inconsistency, by showing the previous three identical changes where you didn’t raise this objection?

Then you say ‘You’re right, those should be changed too.’ Be careful not to take any personal responsibility – _you’re_ not volunteering to change all the existing cases. If you’re really lucky the developer will interpret this as instructions to change the existing cases themself, and then you’ve saved yourself a lot of effort.

## But seriously, folks …

Up to here, this article has been a joke.

(I’d hope I don’t even have to say that at all, but I’m sure _somebody_ would have misunderstood otherwise.)

I’m not _really_ intending to encourage code reviewers to be annoying and obstructive. And I’m not even really suggesting that code reviewers _do_ do all these bad things, at least on purpose, at least most of the time. Most of the descriptions above are exaggerations of what the reviewer really does. Or not even that: just an exaggeration of what it _feels_ like, when you’re the frustrated patch submitter, and your patch has been stuck in review for weeks, and doesn’t feel as if it’s getting any closer.

I really mean: _don’t_ do these things! Try to minimise round trips, rather than maximising them. Ask for important rewrites (if needed) _before_ picking all the trivial nits. When you criticise the patch, make constructive suggestions about what version of it you _would_ accept. If you have opinions about the code base as a whole, raise them with all the developers in a general discussion, rather than being petty with the one developer whose patch you’re assigned to review. And if you do any of these things _by accident_, have some self-awareness about it: notice that you’ve made the developer’s life extra difficult by mistake, apologise, and try to compensate by being extra helpful. (Maybe even help to improve the actual code, either by writing your own revised version of this patch, or doing extra polishing in a followup patch of your own.)

But if there’s a serious point to make here, I think it’s this. When one developer becomes the code reviewer for another one’s patch, that relationship creates temporary _authority_. The reviewer has the power to prevent that particular patch being committed, even if they don’t have any kind of authority over the patch submitter the rest of the time.

With authority comes responsibility. You’re supposed to use the authority only for its intended purpose, and only as much as necessary. In this case, that’s to make the patch as good as possible, according to whatever definition of ‘good’ the development team as a whole has agreed on.

So most of these antipatterns (or the milder behaviours that they’re caricaturing) are _abuses of authority_. The reviewer is using that temporary power over another developer as leverage to pursue some other personal agenda, perhaps independent of the goodness of the patch, or perhaps actively opposed to it.

The personal agenda in question varies between these antipatterns. It could be some unrelated piece of work the reviewer is in favour of; it could be personal stylistic preferences that the reviewer hasn’t been able to get the rest of the team to adopt; it could be laziness, taking advantage of the opportunity to write a one-line description of what you want and let someone else do the hard work; it could just be plain resistance to change, or perhaps even a personal dislike of the patch submitter.

And that dislike might be quite justifiable, if the patch submitter has done any of these bad behaviours when it was last _their_ turn to be the code reviewer! That’s another reason you should use the code reviewer’s authority sparingly. If developers manage to get locked into a cycle of revenge against each other, your software project is doomed.

### Gatekeeping code review

Up to this point, I’ve been focused on _peer_ code review. The code reviewer and the patch submitter are colleagues; neither is in charge of the other; neither has the final say over the code base in general. That’s why the authority you get in a code review is _temporary_: tomorrow, after this patch lands, you won’t have it any more. The day after that, it might be the other way round.

Also, in peer review situations, the code reviewer and the author are supposed to have basically the same goal. If there’s any serious disagreement about what features should go into the code at all, or how polished something needs to be before approval, or what the acceptable coding style is, it’s supposed to be dealt with outside the context of the code review.

But in other kinds of code review situation, that’s not quite the way it works. In particular, if an outsider to your software project sends you an unsolicited patch, that’s very different.

(This scenario usually comes up in free software, since anyone in the world can modify your source code, and some of them will try sending the changes back to you. But it can happen in other situations too – inside a company developing proprietary code, a developer in one team might try their luck sending a patch to another team’s project, if they particularly want a feature or fix that the other team hasn’t found effort for.)

In this situation, there’s a much bigger chance that the receiver of the patch will be unwilling to accept it at all, either because they don’t think that change should be made in the first place, or they disagree completely with the way it was done. And in this case, that’s _not_ an abuse of the temporary authority granted by being a peer reviewer: it’s a legitimate exercise of the _permanent_ authority of being the person or team in charge of the project. It’s my software project – I get to decide what direction it goes in.

When the code reviewer is in this ‘gatekeeping’ role, it’s not always wrong to criticise the patch on the grounds that it violates an existing general design principle or requirement ([The Guessing Game](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/code-review-antipatterns/?ref=dailydev#guessing-game)), without suggesting how the same problem could be solved better. Maybe I don’t _know_ how that problem could be solved in a way that’s consistent with the requirement. In fact, maybe that’s precisely the hard part, and the only reason why I haven’t already made the same change myself!

But even in a gatekeeping context, it’s rude to deploy ‘The Guessing Game’ _without explaining_. When I do this, I generally try to explain how the developer has overlooked the hard part, and if I don’t know the answer myself, I’ll say so.

And, of course, there’s still no excuse for _passive-aggressive_ obstructiveness like [The Death of a Thousand Round Trips](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/code-review-antipatterns/?ref=dailydev#round-trips). If you genuinely don’t want the patch in the code at all, and you’re in a gatekeeping role with the legitimate authority to make that decision, you can _say so_ in words, so the submitter doesn’t waste any more time on it!

## Disclaimer

I’ve been collecting notes towards this article for many years, from code reviews I’ve participated in (on _both_ sides), code reviews I’ve observed between others, and code reviews I’ve only heard about in conversation.

So it’s not aimed at any specific person who’s reviewed my code recently!
