## Creative apps to try

**[Sketchy](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-CnOedusqb-sketchy)** is my favorite Custom GPT. I use it to create instant black-and-white drawings for this newsletter without having the skill to ink them myself.

**How to use it:** Describe in a sentence or phrase any object, place or scene you have in mind. Reference a specific style of car, instrument, house or whatever else you‚Äôre envisioning, as I did with the images below.

![Violin Drawing (Wide Format): This is a detailed pen and ink black and white drawing of a violin in a wide format. The violin, positioned diagonally in the center, is exquisitely detailed, showcasing the fine craftsmanship of its wood, strings, and bow. Its curved body, ornate scroll, and the f-holes are intricately depicted. The strings are meticulously drawn over the bridge, and the drawing emphasizes the glossy texture of the violin. The background is pure white, highlighting the intricate details and subtle shadows of the violin, creating a timeless and sophisticated illustration.  Classic Car Drawing: A detailed pen and ink black and white drawing of a classic car. The vintage car is elegantly designed, featuring distinct curves and lines characteristic of classic automobile design. The round headlights, prominent grille, and sleek body shape are prominently highlighted. Positioned at a three-quarter angle, the car's side and front are dynamically depicted. The drawing emphasizes the glossy texture and intricate details like the chrome accents and spoked wheels. The pure white background focuses attention on the car's detailed silhouette and the interplay of light and shadow.  Snowy Day in Kyoto Drawing: This image is a detailed pen and ink black and white drawing of a serene, snowy day in Kyoto. Traditional Japanese buildings with snow-covered curved roofs are depicted, with gentle snowflakes falling from the sky. The scene includes tall, slender bamboo trees and a small, elegant stone bridge, contributing to the serene landscape. The drawing captures subtle details like the snow patterns on rooftops and delicate tree branches, creating a peaceful and picturesque winter scene. The pure white background accentuates the soft contrasts and textures of the snowy landscape, conveying the quiet and mystical atmosphere of Kyoto in winter.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40a72d2-854a-474e-a90c-0f850d496c5b_1024x1024.png)![Violin Drawing (Wide Format): This is a detailed pen and ink black and white drawing of a violin in a wide format.

Images created in seconds with Sketchy

**[Consensus](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-bo0FiWLY7-consensus)** is fantastic for querying published research from millions of academic papers. It‚Äôs terrific for learning what science and academia has to say on anything you‚Äôre curious about.

**How to use it:** Get a summary of key research on any subject you ask about. I was curious about research on the benefits of taking notes by hand vs. with a computer. Here‚Äôs the [response](https://chatgpt.com/share/6744f1ec-d302-479c-96cc-219e9e910dd1), summarizing and linking to research on the subject, including an addendum after I posed a follow-up question.

**Hint:** Use follow-ups to dive deeper into relevant sub-areas of research. I appreciate that each summary is drawn from a specific published study and includes a citation link I can follow.

**[Whimsical](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-vI2kaiM9N-ai-diagrams)** Create a detailed diagram for anything you can imagine. I asked for a diagram illustrating the complete works of one of my favorite contemporary non-fiction writers, Alain de Botton. The [first draft](https://chatgpt.com/share/e3308825-45cc-497f-a62c-c1521fa5c121) omitted a few of the books, so I requested a revision, shown below.

**How to use it:** Describe the diagram you‚Äôd like to see. The app works well for flowcharts, mind maps and sequence diagrams. You can provide initial information for it to outline. If you ask it to gather info, check its work.

Suggest revisions on the initial draft. Then click the link the app provides to open the diagram in [Whimsical](http://whimsical.com/), an online design tool. There you can make further refinements to the diagram, save, download, share, or print it.

**[Trey Ratcliff's Fun Photo Critique GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-gWki9zYNV-trey-ratcliff-s-fun-photo-critique-gpt)** Upload any photograph and get fast free feedback based on insights from books and 5,000 blog posts by Ratcliff, an expert photographer and photo educator. This app combines expert knowledge as encoded in his writing, along with AI vision ‚Äî the capacity for ChatGPT to see and understand what‚Äôs in an image.

**How to use it:** Upload a photo you‚Äôve taken to get detailed feedback. I was surprised at how human the input felt, even when rendered on a screen. I asked follow-up questions for further suggestions.

**Tip:** Use this app not just for photo feedback but also to learn photo techniques, get a personalized photo learning plan, or to request photo challenges based on your interests to improve your skills.

**[Cartoonize Yourself](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-gFFsdkfMC-cartoonize-yourself)** turns your images into Pixar-style caricatures. Take a classic public domain photo and give it a fresh look.

### ChatGPT apps to check out

-   **[Data Analyst](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-HMNcP6w7d-data-analyst)** is ChatGPT‚Äôs own app for analyzing data. In addition to helping you clean, analyze and understand, analyze and clean data, the app will visualize it for you as well.

    -   **[Example](https://chatgpt.com/share/5b69162e-bfeb-40b5-b514-e5d42ed57fbc).** I uploaded data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/most-streamed-spotify-songs-2024), a free repository where I often find interesting data sets. I asked Data Analyst to visualize the artists with the most Spotify streams in 2024. I also had it create a pie chart comparing explicit vs. non-explicit songs.
        
    -   **[Data Analysis Buddy](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-3UCntyIGy-data-analysis-buddy)** is also useful for analyzing data. It‚Äôs especially good at quickly assessing a data set, suggesting interesting questions to explore with the data, then presenting

-   **[Logo Creator](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-gFt1ghYJl-logo-creator)** Get a quick custom logo. I found it fun playing with this, but it didn‚Äôt yield usable logos. Instead, try the [free Namecheap online logo creator](https://namecheap.com/logo-maker/app/new).

-   **[Canva](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-alKfVrz9K-canva)** makes the most popular productivity app for ChatGPT.

I found the results mediocre. The public seems to agree, giving it a rating of 3.0 out of 5.

### Who creates these apps?

-   Anyone with a $20 ChatGPT Plus subscription can create an app by giving ChatGPT custom instructions and/or documentation. Here‚Äôs my post with tips on [how to make one](https://wondertools.substack.com/p/make-your-own-chatgpt-bot).
    

-   Some apps are created by companies like [Kayak](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-hcqdAuSMv-kayak-flights-hotels-cars) who can link ChatGPT to their existing service.
    
-   Other apps are created by hobbyists or experts who upload PDFs to train a ChatGPT app to understand specific techniques, policies or examples.
    
-   Creators can also instruct an app to interact with a particular tone, to ask certain questions, or to focus on a narrow task ‚Äî like creating a logo, helping with scholarly research, or generating charts.
    

### Caveats

**Clutter.** Because anyone can create an app, with no licensing or quality-control approval required, the marketplace is cluttered with mediocre options. Cast a skeptical initial eye on responses you get from apps of unclear origin.

**Privacy.** Be careful with private data you upload to ChatGPT. OpenAI may in some cases use what you submit to train its models. Consider adjusting your [privacy controls](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7730893-data-controls-faq).

**Cost.** Custom GPTs are free, but creating your own requires a $20 monthly [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-plus/) subscription.
