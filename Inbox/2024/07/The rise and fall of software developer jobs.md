Demand for software developers has plunged from the boom times of 2021 and 2022.

**Why it matters:** Even though the [labor market](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/11/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-us-labor-market) remains strong, the supply of higher-paying white-collar jobs (tech, marketing and finance) is pretty meh.

-   These positions, "what we once would've called office jobs," are the weakest spot in the labor market, says Nick Bunker, an economist at Indeed.

**Catch up fast:** There was a pandemic hiring frenzy for these roles. Workers were fielding multiple calls a day from recruiters and naming their price when it came to salary.

-   Now, companies are slower to hire now and less willing to expand headcount, Bunker says.
-   The decline in demand is likely not an AI thing — the drop-off started before the introduction of ChatGPT.

**The big picture:** These are still among the best jobs around.

-   Software developer is ranked second on the [Labor Department](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2023/article/industry-and-occupational-employment-projections-overview-and-highlights-2022-32.htm)'s list of occupations with the most projected job growth over the next decade or so, coming in after home health aides.
-   And the pay is good. The lowest-paid software developers, located in the Cleveland metro area, earn a median salary of more than $100,000 per year, per a study from [ADP](https://www.adpri.org/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-software-developer/) last month. The highest paid work in Silicon Valley and earn a median of $163,000.

**The bottom line:** Good jobs are harder to find.

Openings for tech jobs like engineer or software developer have spiked as an already tight U.S. job market weathers the economy-wide effects of the pandemic.

**The big picture:** Tech workers were in high demand pre-pandemic, and the COVID era's rapid moves to digital further intensified that need.

Companies are posting fewer job listings, especially for white-collar roles in software, human resources, and banking and finance, per new data from Indeed.

**Why it matters:** It's a sign of how the [job market](https://www.axios.com/2023/04/04/the-job-market-is-still-weird) is slowing down a bit for higher wage earners and the professional class.
