At The Elysian, it is my goal, not to point out all the problems with the world, but to think through the solutions—to dream up a better future through essays and fiction, while studying humanist and utopian thought alongside paid subscribers.

Here’s a complete collection of my work so far.

I publish essays thinking through a better future. Here’s the collection so far:

## Fiction

I serialized my first novel, a gothic novel called Obscurity, in 2021-2022. Now I’m working on a utopian novel that I will serialize when it’s complete. I also write short fiction.
