**Dan Siegel** - Microsoft MVP  
**Years of experience:** 28 years writing code (14 full-time / professionally)  
**Dev Environment:** Visual Studio on Windows  
**Favorite Library:** [Prism](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism)

**Dan‚Äôs Top 3 Productivity Tips:**

1.  Step Away: Take breaks away from your computer. Many solutions to complex issues come to mind when you're not actively working on them.  
    ‚ÄúHonestly, you'd be surprised how many answers/solutions I come up with for things I'm working on when I walk away from the computer and go to lunch. I have even fixed bugs or come up with radical ideas for solving a complex issue while I'm on the dive boat. Software development is a creative process... and many times you need to get away from the computer to let your brain solve problems.
    
2.  Development is a team sport. No matter how good you think you can make something, you‚Äôll make something better collaborating with someone else. Sometimes, the simple exercise of explaining it to someone else can lead to mind-blowing breakthroughs.
    
3.  When you‚Äôre working with open-source code, don‚Äôt be afraid to look at the code. You‚Äôd be amazed at how many things you‚Äôll have a better understanding of just by looking at the code, and how many possibilities that will unlock for you.

**Martin Zikmund** - Microsoft MVP  
**Years of experience:** 15 years  
**Dev Environment:** Visual Studio on Windows  
**Favorite Library:** [Uno Platform](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno) (of course üòÅ)

**Martin‚Äôs Top 3 Productivity Tips:**

1.  Invest in workplace: If you have control over your environment, investment into everything you are using while working is a worthwhile investment. This means a quality PC to ensure its performance does not hinder your efficiency; comfortable chair to save your back; standing desk; and ergonomic keyboard and mouse. You are likely spending a lot of time at your PC, so any investments in this regard are worthwhile as they will return to you in both health and time.
    
2.  Use PowerToys: Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Windows is a productive OS out of the box, however, you can make it even better by extending it with useful tools. And one of the best comes directly from Microsoft ‚Äì PowerToys! It is a set of small modules that enhance the OS in ways that will make it hard to imagine your life without after you integrate it into your workflow. I am currently making a series of videos about this on my YouTube channel, if you want to learn more!
    
3.  Know your shortcuts: Nothing can speed up your work as much as knowing keyboard shortcuts of your IDE and other apps you use frequently. Just not having to reach for your mouse and being able to keep your hands on the keyboard saves a surprising amount of time! So, find the list of keyboard shortcuts, print it out, and start learning them as you go. My trick to learn faster is to put your mouse on the side of your non-dominant hand for 30 minutes. Just the fact that the mouse is not where you expect it will make force you to think whether using a keyboard shortcut could be better for that specific task!

**Steve Bilogan** - Microsoft MVP  
**Years of experience:** 8.5 years  
**Dev Environment:** Visual Studio on Windows / VS Code on macOS  
**Favorite Library:** unoplatform/uno.toolkit.ui

**Steve‚Äôs Top 3 Productivity Tips:**

1.  Take a walk, every couple of hours or whenever needed: walk around the block, let your mind wander, decompress, and come back fresh.
    
2.  Visual Studio CTRL+T Quick Search can search by just the capital letters. Example: Searching for RDP.xaml will resolve properly to RecipeDetailsPage.xaml
    
3.  Open on GitHub - Visual Studio Marketplace Great extension for quickly opening the highlighted lines in the browser from the GitHub repo. Great for needing to quickly grab the link to lines that you are talking about when communicating on Teams

**Youssef Victor** - Microsoft MVP  
**Years of experience:** 2 years  
**Dev Environment**: Visual Studio on Windows  
**Favorite Library:** NodaTime, PolySharp

**Youssef‚Äôs Top 3 Productivity Tips:**

1.  Master Keyboard Shortcuts: Learn to use Visual Studio's Quick Search (Ctrl+T) to navigate quickly through both your code and IDE features.
2.  Leverage Multi-Caret Editing: Use your editor's multi-caret functionality in specific situations where it can significantly speed up your editing process. This allows you to edit multiple locations in your code simultaneously.
    
3.  Consider using grep.app for advanced text searching within your codebase. It offers more powerful search capabilities than the basic search functions within your editor.
