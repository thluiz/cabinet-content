It’s necessary for early- to mid-career professionals to hone their power and influence.

<small>getty</small>

Throughout my career as an organizational psychologist and DEI expert, I’ve witnessed the disproportionate distribution of power and influence in many organizations. Often, dominant identities are overrepresented in positions of leadership in Corporate America. While improving, true diversity in organizational leadership still has a long way to go.

Considering this, it’s not only okay but necessary for early- to mid-career professionals, especially those with non-dominant identities, to hone their power and influence. By doing so, they arm themselves to become the next generation equipped to lead the world’s increasingly diverse and interconnected workforce.

Let’s have a look at some common misconceptions surrounding the desire for power and influence and explain why developing effective leadership skills is not only appropriate but also beneficial and necessary.

## **Defining Neutral Power**

Power is defined as the [ability to control people and events.](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/power "https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/power") Many people believe the desire to gain power and influence is somehow intrinsically negative or self-serving. On the contrary, it is actually a universal trait for humans to seek personal empowerment in many different facets of their lives.

Think about the last time you went to the gym, invested funds, or spoke your truth. These are all everyday examples of exerting personal power.

Descriptions such as “power-hungry” and “drunk with power” insinuate that power is an inherently negative or even evil thing. And when abused, it can be.

However, the mere [concept of personal power](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-to-understand-power-eric-liu/watch "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-to-understand-power-eric-liu/watch") is not an intrinsically good or bad thing. It’s simply a universal dynamic that is always at play in some way. Keeping this in mind, it’s easy to see that access to power should be a human right rather than a privilege reserved for elite groups.

The idea that power and influence are “bad” undermines what it means to be a great leader. For leaders to be effective, they must possess a healthy amount of sway with their teams. This means having the power and influence required to create buy-in for an organization’s vision, motivate others to help achieve it, and continuously drive progress.

## **Distribution of Power**

People with dominant identities (namely white men) have historically dominated the corporate landscape in America. Because white men were long viewed as the dominant identity group, resources, opportunities, and positions of influence were offered to them often.

This, by default has made, and sometimes continues to make, it more difficult for non-dominant identity groups to gain their share of influence in the workforce.

The accepted and often unspoken corporate playbook on how to gain power and influence (and therefore find success in climbing the ladder) was written ages ago with only one group in mind. Since the playbook is not inclusive, these traditional “rules” and tactics don’t consider the role identity plays in the workplace. When utilized by non-dominant identities, it can result in very different and sometimes negative outcomes.

This is a key reason why I authored a book on the “cheat codes” for professionals navigating the corporate world. I took what I’d learned in my experience as both a DEI professional and a Black woman to translate the outdated playbook into practical advice that could benefit underrepresented groups rather than potentially impede their progress. These tools not only help to level the playing field but also pave the way for a future led by _all_, not just select groups.

## **Inclusive Influence**

The immense value of diverse leadership can’t be overstated. In a 21st-century corporate environment claiming to prioritize diversity and inclusion, it’s only right for non-dominant groups to be considered for opportunities at all levels of leadership.

Prioritizing inclusivity at the leadership level harnesses the often untapped asset of underrepresented groups’ unique experiences. Diversity in leadership fosters innovative solutions and an overall deeper understanding of diverse markets and communities.

Without proportionate representation, leadership can make decisions based on incomplete data or lean too heavily on their own conscious or unconscious biases. A varied and empowered leadership team promotes accountability and effective communication between diverse groups. Developing competence in cross-cultural communication can help us gain new perspectives, become more mindful of our communication, and intervene in some of these negative cycles.

By aspiring to positions of power and influence, we can help shape organizational cultures that value and leverage diversity as a strength rather than a checkbox. Developing your power and influence will prepare you to seize opportunities where your unique skills, experiences, and perspectives can be valued.
