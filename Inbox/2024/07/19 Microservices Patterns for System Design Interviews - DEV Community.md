Hello friends, if you are preparing for system design interviews then it make sense to to prepare for Microservices design patterns as well, not just to do well on interviews or make your architecture more robust but also to understand existing projects.

Microservices patterns like Cicuit Breaker, API Gateway, Saga, Event Sourcing are tried and tested solution of common Microservices Problems.

These patterns address [common challenges in microservices architectures](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/10-microservices-architecture-challenges-for-system-design-interviews-6g0) like scalability, fault tolerance, and data consistency.

In the past, I have talked about common system design questions like [API Gateway vs Load Balancer](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/difference-between-api-gateway-and-load-balancer-in-system-design-54dd) and [Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/horizontal-scaling-vs-vertical-scaling-in-system-design-3n09), [Forward proxy vs reverse proxy](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/difference-between-forward-proxy-and-reverse-proxy-in-system-design-54g5) as well common [System Design problems](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/top-50-system-design-interview-questions-for-2024-5dbk) and in this article I am going to share 24 key Microservices design patterns that are essential knowledge for technical interviews.

They are also one of the [essential System design topics for interview](https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-10-system-design-concepts-every-programmer-should-learn-54375d8557a6) and you must prepare it well.

Many companies use microservices, so understanding these patterns shows you're up-to-date with current trends. Knowing when and how to apply these patterns also demonstrates your ability to solve complex distributed system problems.

These patterns often involve trade-offs, allowing you to showcase your analytical thinking and Interviewers often present scenarios where these patterns are relevant solutions.

By the way, if you are preparing for System design interviews and want to learn System Design in depth then you can also checkout sites like [**ByteByteGo**](https://bit.ly/3P3eqMN), [**Design Guru**](https://bit.ly/3pMiO8g), [**Exponent**](https://bit.ly/3cNF0vw), [**Educative**](https://bit.ly/3Mnh6UR) and [**Udemy**](https://bit.ly/3vFNPid) which have many great System design courses and a System design interview template like this which you can use to answer any System Design question.

## [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#19-microservices-design-patterns-for-system-design-interviews)19 Microservices Design Patterns for System Design Interviews

[Microservices architecture](https://medium.com/javarevisited/difference-between-microservices-and-monolithic-architecture-for-java-interviews-af525908c2d5) is a design approach that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

To build scalable, maintainable, and resilient microservices-based systems, various patterns have emerged.

Here are essential microservices patterns you can use in your project and also remember for system design interviews.

### [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#1-service-registry)1\. Service Registry

Since there are many microservices in Microservice architecture they need to discover and communicate with each other.

A [Service Registry](https://medium.com/javarevisited/service-registry-design-pattern-in-microservices-explained-a796494c608e), such as Netflix Eureka or Consul, acts as a centralized directory where services can register themselves and discover others.

Here is how it looks like:

[![Service Registry Pattern](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fa1zmvopa0oer8mo4qbas.png)](https://www.java67.com/2023/06/what-is-service-discovery-pattern-what.html)

___

### [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#2-api-gateway)2\. API Gateway

An [API Gateway](https://medium.com/javarevisited/what-is-api-gateway-pattern-in-microservices-architecture-what-problem-does-it-solve-ebf75ae84698) serves as a single entry point for client applications, aggregating multiple microservices into a unified API.

It handles requests, routing them to the appropriate services, and may perform tasks like authentication, authorization, and load balancing.

Here is how API Gateway looks like:

[![API Gateway](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdquilct7nvdkgnn3tvrb.jpg)](https://medium.com/javarevisited/what-is-api-gateway-pattern-in-microservices-architecture-what-problem-does-it-solve-ebf75ae84698)

___

### [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#3-circuit-breaker)3\. Circuit Breaker

Inspired by electrical circuit breakers, this pattern prevents a microservices failure from cascading to other services. [Circuit breaker pattern](https://medium.com/javarevisited/what-is-circuit-breaker-design-pattern-in-microservices-java-spring-cloud-netflix-hystrix-example-f285929d7f68) monitors for failures, and if a threshold is crossed, it opens the circuit, preventing further requests.

This helps in graceful degradation and fault tolerance and its absolutely must in a Microservice architecture to prevent total shutdown of your services.

Here is an example of Netflix Hysrix as Circuit breaker:

[![Circuit Breaker](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4io0vvqpxxm5r61x2eco.png)](https://medium.com/javarevisited/what-is-circuit-breaker-design-pattern-in-microservices-java-spring-cloud-netflix-hystrix-example-f285929d7f68)

___

### [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#4-bulkhead)4\. Bulkhead

In a microservices system, isolating failures is crucial. The Bulkhead pattern involves separating components or services to contain failures.

For example, thread pools or separate databases for different services can be used to prevent a failure in one part of the system from affecting others.

Here is a diagram showing Bulkhead pattern in Microservices architecture:

[![Bulkhead Pattern](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fq1lmbv2z4alb9rn4c52f.png)](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fq1lmbv2z4alb9rn4c52f.png)

___

### [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#5-saga-pattern)5\. Saga Pattern

This pattern is used for managing distributed transactions. The Saga pattern breaks down a long-running business transaction into a series of smaller, independent transactions.

Each microservice involved in the saga handles its own transaction and publishes events to trigger subsequent actions.

Here is how [Saga Pattern](https://medium.com/javarevisited/what-is-saga-pattern-in-microservice-architecture-which-problem-does-it-solve-de45d7d01d2b) looks in action:

[![Saga Pattern](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fy2s5glp78opmqqumjbha.png)](https://www.java67.com/2022/12/saga-microservice-design-pattern-in-java.html)

___

### [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#6-event-sourcing)6\. Event Sourcing

This is another popular pattern which is used heavily in high frequently low latency applications.

In this pattern, instead of storing only the current state, [Event Sourcing](https://medium.com/javarevisited/what-is-event-sourcing-design-pattern-in-microservices-architecture-how-does-it-work-b38c996d445a) involves storing a sequence of events that led to the current state.

This pattern provides a reliable audit trail and allows for rebuilding the system state at any point in time.

Here is how Event Sourcing looks in action:

[![Event Sourcing](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fczu6xk96dsluau2wvdlz.png)](https://www.java67.com/2023/01/event-sourcing-pattern-in-java.html)

___

### [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#7-command-query-responsibility-segregation-cqrs)7\. Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

[CQRS Pattern](https://medium.com/javarevisited/what-is-cqrs-command-and-query-responsibility-segregation-pattern-7b1b38514edd) separates the read and write sides of an application. It uses different models for updating information (commands) and reading information (queries).

This pattern can improve scalability, as read and write operations have different optimization requirements.

Here is a nice diagram which shows CQRS pattern:

[![Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fy9cckf41czuapw0g8v5g.png)](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2023/04/what-is-cqrs-design-pattern-in.html)

___

### [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#8-data-sharding)8\. Data Sharding

Database sharing pattern is used to distribute the database load and avoid bottlenecks, [Data Sharding](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/database-sharding-for-system-design-interview-1k6b) involves partitioning data across multiple databases or database instances.

In this pattern, each microservice may handle a subset of data or specific types of requests.

Here is how database sharding looks like, credit - [Design Guru](https://bit.ly/3pMiO8g)

[![Types of Database sharding](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F42ob2tziqrlt820gdsy7.jpg)](https://bit.ly/3pMiO8g)

___

### [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#9-polyglot-persistence)9\. Polyglot Persistence

Different microservices may have different data storage needs. Polyglot Persistence allows using multiple database technologies based on the requirements of each microservice, optimizing for data storage, retrieval, and query capabilities.

Here is a nice diagram which shows Polyglot persistence in Azure :

[![Polyglot Persistence](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzadmkgdvmzkcvysmc4pa.PNG)](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzadmkgdvmzkcvysmc4pa.PNG)

___

### [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#10-retry)10\. Retry

In Microservice architecture, when a transient failure occurs, the Retry pattern involves retrying the operation instead of immediately failing.

It can be applied at various levels, such as service-to-service communication or database interactions.

Here is a nice diagram form [ByteByteGo](https://bit.ly/3P3eqMN), a great place for system design learning which shows Retry pattern in Microservices:

[![Retry Pattern in Microservices](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fe8kuq35ktdfxjfhecjoj.jpg)](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fe8kuq35ktdfxjfhecjoj.jpg)

___

### [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#12-sidecar)12\. Sidecar

The Sidecar pattern involves attaching a helper service (the sidecar) to the main microservice to provide additional functionalities such as logging, security, or communication with external services.

This allows the main service to focus on its core functionality.

Here is how a Sidecar pattern looks like:

[![Sidecar pattern in Microservices](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fimhtu2b7mml6atekcqu6.png)](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fimhtu2b7mml6atekcqu6.png)

___

### [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#13-backends-for-frontends-bff)13\. Backends for Frontends (BFF)

Also known as BFF this pattern is useful when dealing with multiple client types (e.g., web, mobile), the BFF pattern involves creating separate backend services tailored for each type of client.

This allows for optimized and specialized APIs for each client.

Here is how a Backends for Frontends (BFF) pattern looks like:

[![Backends for Frontends (BFF)](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fp1tdrwa7bzotkohzitpr.png)](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fp1tdrwa7bzotkohzitpr.png)

___

### [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#14-shadow-deployment)14\. Shadow Deployment

The Shadow Deployment pattern involves routing a copy (shadow) of production traffic to a new microservice version without affecting the actual user experience.

This is one of the popular deployment strategy and it helps validate the new version's performance and correctness.

Here is how shadow deployment looks like

[![Shadow Deployment](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdopj5ojhur8zk8g84ytz.png)](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdopj5ojhur8zk8g84ytz.png)

___

### [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#15-consumerdriven-contracts)15\. Consumer-Driven Contracts

In a microservices ecosystem, multiple services often interact with one another. The Consumer-Driven Contracts pattern involves consumers specifying their expectations from producers, allowing for more robust and coordinated changes.

Here is a nice diagram which explains Consumer Driven contracts

[![Consumer-Driven Contracts](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Flks09b6cxuhwea5la5pp.png)](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/09/microservices-design-patterns-principles.html)

___

### [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#16-smart-endpoints-dumb-pipes)16\. Smart Endpoints, Dumb Pipes

This pattern advocates for placing business logic in microservices (smart endpoints) rather than relying on complex middleware. The communication infrastructure (pipes) should be simple and handle only message routing.

___

### [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#17-database-per-service)17\. Database per Service

This is another popular Microservices pattern where each microservice has its own database, and services communicate through well-defined APIs.

[Database per Service pattern](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2022/11/database-per-microservice-pattern-java.html) provides isolation but also requires careful consideration of data consistency and integrity.

Here is how this pattern looks like:

[![Database per Service pattern](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fp1618z10nohkuvlyjl3a.png)](https://medium.com/javarevisited/what-is-database-per-microservices-pattern-what-problem-does-it-solve-60b8c5478825)

___

### [](https://dev.to/somadevtoo/19-microservices-patterns-for-system-design-interviews-3o39?context=digest#18-async-messaging)18\. Async Messaging

Instead of synchronous communication between microservices, the Async Messaging pattern involves using message queues to facilitate asynchronous communication. This can improve system responsiveness and scalability.

Here is a nice diagram which shows difference between sync and async messaging

[![Async Messaging pattern](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fgwi955d8eatod6zzmezh.png)](https://medium.com/javarevisited/how-microservices-communicates-with-each-other-synchronous-vs-asynchronous-communication-pattern-31ca01027c53)
