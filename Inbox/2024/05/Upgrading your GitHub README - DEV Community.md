Hello everyone!

How's everyone doing? Today I came here to talk about GitHub. **Since I'm starting my studies as a developer again, I saw that it's important to update my GitHub and make it presentable.**

I have been using my account for a few years, but sometimes I forgot to keep it up to date. This year, I'm going to do my best to keep it updated with all the projects and content I'm working on.

I changed my bio and [README](https://github.com/MichelleMello), updated my social media, and also updated my projects. I want my profile to represent who I am and what I want for my life/future.

As I was changing my profile, I was thinking, "What are the best practices to have on GitHub? What is the market looking for?". **And that made me write here and ask you guys: What do you think is important in a GitHub profile? Leave your tips in the comments!**.

_PS: If you feel like, please let me know what [I can do to make my profile better](https://github.com/MichelleMello)! I would really appreciate it! And leave your profiles here in the comments so everyone can meet, get inspired, and connect!_
