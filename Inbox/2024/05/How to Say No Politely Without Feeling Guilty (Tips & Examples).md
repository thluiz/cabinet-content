_“Yes, sure, I can take that on. Don’t worry about it.”_

How many times have you said those words and immediately regretted it, knowing that your plate is already full?

If you also have a hard time saying “no” to things, I’m with you. Saying “no” is a challenge many of us face.

The more we advance in our career—and life in general—the more demands are going to be put on us, to the extent that we won’t have time to meet all of them. Prioritizing, triaging, and cutting things become the only solutions.

**Saying “no” creates time, and who doesn’t need more time?**

In today’s article we’re covering:

-   why saying “no” is difficult
    
-   why learning to say “no” is a key life skill
    
-   strategies + examples for effectively saying “no” guilt-free
    

## **Why is it so hard to say no?**

The reason varies from person to person. Most people—myself included—struggle with saying “no” for the following reasons:

-   don’t want to seem rude, unkind or selfish
    
-   don’t want to hurt people’s feelings
    
-   trying to avoid conflict
    
-   out of obligation
    
-   fear of negative consequences / retaliation
    
-   fear of missing out—FOMO
    

The list can go on, feeling like this is very normal and more common than we think.

The thing that we often forget is:

-   You can’t control how people react – some might be disappointed, and others might appreciate you more.
    
-   Saying "yes" and not following through will make people more upset than if you had said "no" from the beginning.
    
-   Whether we choose "yes" or "no", each option has an opportunity cost that we must not overlook.
    

Saying _no_ takes strength so here are some mindset shifts that make saying “no” feel less icky:

-   **Think of it as a tradeoff**
    
    -   when you say no to something, you say yes to something else, both are opportunities
        
-   **You’re saying “no” to the request, not the person**
    
    -   you’re not rejecting the person, just declining their proposal
        
    -   make that clear & let them know
        
-   **You have to say no to good opportunities in order to say yes to great ones**
    

Nobody knew that better than Steve Jobs, who said:

Innovation is saying ‘no’ to 1,000 things.

## **How saying “no” more often will improve your life**

When you learn to say no, life becomes much more uncomplicated and enjoyable. This applies to work, friends, family, relationships, you name it.

Being deliberate about what you say “yes” to gives you better control over your time.

Saying “no” is an excellent way of **[reducing overwhelm and managing stress better](https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/counselling/saying-no.htm)**—you’ll sign up for fewer things and have more energy to do them better. It’s also an [anti-burnout strategy](https://www.thecaringtechie.com/i/38548756/say-no).

Also, [saying “no”](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-matters-from-menninger/202111/the-power-of-saying-no) **[increases confidence](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-matters-from-menninger/202111/the-power-of-saying-no)**. There is nothing more empowering than saying “no” to something that’s not aligned with your values, your goals, and your desires. Staying true to yourself is the highest form of self-validation.

Lastly, people will respect you for having **healthy boundaries**.

## **Strategies for saying “no” + Examples**

When you say “no”, for maximum effectiveness keep the following in mind:

1.  Be polite, but don’t sugarcoat.
    
2.  Use a calm but assertive voice
    
3.  Stay firm in your stance, and don’t waiver even if the other side is pushy
    
4.  Remember:
    
    -   a no can easily become a yes, but it’s harder to go from yes to no
        
    -   resist the urge to justify or over-explain yourself
        

Other things that might help:

-   having a prepared response—or script on how the conversation might go.
    
-   practicing with someone else ahead of time
    

Without further ado, here are my favorite strategies for saying no:

### **Simple decline**

Note that none actually use the word “no”.

> Sadly, I have something else going on.
> 
> I wish I were able to, but ….
> 
> I don't have the bandwidth for that right now.
> 
> I'm honored you asked me, but I simply can't.
> 
> I'm sorry, I'm not able to fit this in.

### **Decline, but counteroffer**

If you’re truly interested in helping, you have the option to offer an alternative. For instance:

> I am not available at that time, but why don’t we find some time for the following week?
> 
> This isn’t in my wheelhouse, but I know someone who might be helpful.

### **Buy more time**

Don’t feel pressured to answer on the spot.

> “I’ll get back to you with an answer” + actually get back to them
> 
> I need to check my calendar. Is it okay if I get back to you in <X days/hours/minutes>?

## **TL;DR**

-   Saying "no" saves time, reduces overwhelm, and increases confidence.
    
-   It's better to say "no" than to make false promises.
    
-   Every "yes" has an opportunity cost that we must not overlook
    
-   Learning to say "no" leads to a more uncomplicated and enjoyable life.
    
-   Strategies for saying "no" include being polite but assertive, offering alternatives, and buying more time.
    

You can do anything, but you can’t do everything. If you want to thrive, not just survive, you must learn to say no.
