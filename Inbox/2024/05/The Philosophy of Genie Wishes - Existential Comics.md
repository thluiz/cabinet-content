Philosophers in this comic: [Plato](https://www.existentialcomics.com/philosopher/Plato "Plato in one of the most important philosophers of all time, in fact Alfred North Whitehead said that all of philosophy was just "a series of footnotes to Plato". From what I understand though, Heraclitus invented footnotes, so who is the real influential philosopher?"), [Zeno of Citium](https://www.existentialcomics.com/philosopher/Zeno_of_Citium "Zeno of Citium is the founder of Stoicism, which he started after Crates the Cynic made fun of him so bad that he cried (seriously). His mom told him that if he just ignored Crates, eventually he would get bored with bullying him. Well, Zeno took this way too seriously and based his whole philosophy on it.")
