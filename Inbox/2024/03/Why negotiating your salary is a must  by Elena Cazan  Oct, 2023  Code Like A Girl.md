I come from a culture where questions are not encouraged, and you take what you are given.

If being a recruiter taught me something, asking for a higher salary doesn’t mean losing your offer or your job. Naturally, when a company makes an offer, they will always go with the low bands and see how the candidate reacts.

This gives them room to increase the offer if the candidate does want to negotiate for better pay.

This implies that your skills and knowledge are valued more highly than initially assessed. It signifies that the market is changing, and a salary suitable for your skills a few months or years ago differs from the current evaluation.

It means that you are worth it more!

**Here are a few of my favourite quotes:**

> “Negotiation is not an act of battle; it’s a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much information as possible.”
> 
> “Persuasion is not about how bright or smooth or forceful you are. It’s about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea. So don’t beat them with logic or brute force. Ask them questions that open paths to your goals.”
> 
> “That’s right” is better than “yes.” Strive for it. Reaching “that’s right” in a negotiation creates breakthroughs.”
> 
> “No deal is better than a bad deal.”
> 
> “Don’t just pay attention to the people you’re negotiating with directly; always identify the motivations of the players “behind the table.”
> 
> “Tactical empathy is understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those feelings so you increase your influence in all the moments that follow.”

This article aims not solely to transform you into a great negotiator but to illustrate why negotiation holds significance. Hopefully, it will ignite a greater desire to delve deeper into this subject.

There are numerous strategies for approaching a salary negotiation, but it comes down to you to start trying different approaches and see what works for you.

In closing, don’t view negotiation as a confrontation but rather as a collaborative process of discovery and understanding.

As you reflect on the art of negotiation, consider its role in shaping your future. In a world where change is constant, negotiation is your tool to ensure that your skills and knowledge are valued as they deserve to be.

As you navigate your career, remember that negotiation isn’t just about getting what you want; it’s about creating opportunities and building mutually beneficial relationships.
