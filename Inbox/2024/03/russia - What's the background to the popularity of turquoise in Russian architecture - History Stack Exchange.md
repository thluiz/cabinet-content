It would be quite difficult to _precisely_ date the era it started as a way to use the colour (and not only the stone) and paint buildings with turquoise, or why people started to like and use it, but there are clues, about the colour, its symbolism and use.

First, the colour itself is saif to protect, bring serenity, luck and many other states of mind.

In Russia and Central Asia turquoise are both strongly associated with the interiors of the large mosques and domes, similar to Iran. Some say that in Russia, turquoise also symbolizes love.<sup>1</sup>

Second, the religion. Here are some pictures of mosques in Russia. Most domes or inside have turquoise on/in it. Nurulla, Vladikavkaz, StPetersburg, Al Fozan... [Mosques in Russia](https://www.google.com/search?q=mosques+in+russia) (see below).

> According to the Bible, the first gemstone listed in the second row of the High Priest's breastplate (Exodus 28:18) could possibly be turquoise. The word for the gemstone in this location is nophek (Strong's Concordance #H5306). \[...\] The possibility exists, however, that nophek could better be rendered as "_turquoise_" given that six out of the ten Bible versions used for comparison purposes in this series translate it as such. These same six Biblical translations also translate nophek, stated as the eighth stone which adorned the symbolic King of Tyre (Ezekiel 28:13) which represented a fallen Lucifer, as "_turquoise_." [Bible study](https://www.biblestudy.org/bible-study-by-topic/gemstones-in-the-bible/turquoise.html)

And there are catholics and orthodox in Russia. So, no matter what the religion might be, that color is associated with it. [The Spiritual Meaning of Turquoise in the Bible](https://biblewithus.com/biblical-meaning-of-turquoise/#:%7E:text=In%20addition%20to%20its%20association,the%20city%27s%20protection%20and%20safety.)

According to my research about that matter, and the little I know about stones and colours (and what people attach to them), it looks like the turquoise color has popular _and_ religious meanings. That would be enough to put it on buildings and jewelry for instance. And that's a possible explanation of the use of it, beyond the fact that it's just (another) beautiful stone/colour that people like.
