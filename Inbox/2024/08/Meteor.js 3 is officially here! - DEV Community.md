In short, Meteor 3.0 brings Node.js 20, Express integration, Fibers removal, async server methods, ARM support, package updates, and new documentation.

### [](https://dev.to/meteor/meteor-3-is-officially-here-3gml#node-v20-and-express-integration)Node v20 and Express Integration

One of the most significant changes in Meteor 3.0 is its integration with Node.js 20 and Express. This update allows Meteor to fully take advantage of the latest features and performance improvements in Node.js 20. Express, a widely used web application framework for Node.js, provides robust tools for building web and mobile applications.

We covered this extensively (and more) in this [article](https://dev.to/meteor/embracing-the-future-meteor-3-with-node-v20-and-express-2bd8).

### [](https://dev.to/meteor/meteor-3-is-officially-here-3gml#package-updates)Package Updates

Meteor 3.0 has numerous package updates, reflecting changes in their dependencies to ensure compatibility with the latest versions. These updates are crucial for maintaining security, stability, and performance. By updating the packages, Meteor ensures developers can access the newest features and improvements available in the broader Node.js and JavaScript ecosystems.

### [](https://dev.to/meteor/meteor-3-is-officially-here-3gml#major-architectural-changes)Major Architectural Changes

Meteor 3.0 introduces substantial architectural changes to modernize the platform and improve its performance and scalability. Key changes include:

-   **Dropping Fibers:** Replacing Fibers with native async/await syntax to align with modern JavaScript standards. This change simplifies the codebase and enhances compatibility with future Node.js releases.
    
-   **Async/Await for MongoDB Interactions:** Making all MongoDB operations asynchronous to improve performance and reduce latency.
    
-   **ARM Architecture Support:** Expanding Meteor's compatibility to include ARM architectures, allowing developers to run Meteor on a wider range of hardware, including Raspberry Pi and other ARM-based devices.
