What makes a great CTO?

Hello readers, this is Kovid Batra, founder of groCTO. I’ve had the privilege of interacting with countless CTOs, gaining invaluable insights into their roles.

For years, I’ve been fascinated by the traits and habits that distinguish highly effective CTOs and VPEs. Through numerous conversations with top CTOs and continuous learning, I have identified key habits that work wonders.

Here are the six micro habits that have proven invaluable in many CTO journeys:

1.  Hold daily stand-ups Rome wasn’t built in a day! As much repetitive and trivial daily stand-ups seem like, they are the ones that define the course of execution each day. They are the stepping stones to the bigger mission that your team is on.

Keep them short, simple & precise - they are super-critical to keep you informed about what’s happening & what needs to be done to drive maximum efficiency.

Why It Works: Daily stand-ups keep everyone aligned, identify roadblocks early, and foster a culture of accountability and communication.

“The stand-up meeting is the heartbeat of an agile team.” - Jeff Sutherland, Co-Creator of Scrum

2.  Schedule deep work sessions Consider deep work as your secret weapon - this is the focus time where you find simple solutions to complex problems and drive innovation. Set a goal for these sessions & figure out a process that works best for you.

Why It Works: Focused periods of work without distractions lead to higher productivity and better quality outputs, crucial for strategic tasks that require deep thinking.

“Focus is about saying no.” - Steve Jobs

3.  DON’T skip one-on-ones However, boring & time-consuming this may sound - conduct regular one-on-one meetings with your team members. Be constructive & factual - this is where the team dynamics start changing & people find the drive to keep pushing for the best.

Why It Works: These meetings provide a platform for direct feedback, personal development discussions, and fostering strong relationships within the team.

“One-on-one meetings are the most important tool you have as a manager. They build trust, uncover issues, and align on goals and expectations." - Ben Horowitz

4.  Keep yourself updated Remember - you’re a perpetual student, constantly learning and adapting to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech game. Dedicate time each week to find what’s new or work on a professional skill that you feel is important for you.

Why It Works: Continuous learning keeps you updated with the latest industry trends and innovations, which is crucial for making informed decisions and leading a tech team effectively.

“Staying relevant as a CTO means never stopping the quest for knowledge; continuous learning is our competitive edge.” - Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon

5.  Move fast No one likes slow! Break down barriers of communication to implement quick and continuous feedback loops within your team. Shorter your product feedback cycle is, faster your delivery. Move fast without breaking things.

Why It Works: Immediate feedback allows for rapid adjustments, improves processes, and fosters a culture of continuous improvement.

“Feedback is the breakfast of champions.” - Ken Blanchard
